# Configuring Categories & Using Tags

A good category and tag system is key to keeping your navigation site clean and efficient. Notion Bookmarks leverages Notion's powerful relation databases and multi-select properties to achieve this.

## Configuring Categories

"Categories" is an independent database used to manage the main groupings of your websites, such as "Work", "Study", "Tools", "Entertainment", etc. This design allows you to add icons, descriptions, and other metadata for each category.

**How to add or modify categories:**

1.  In your Notion workspace, find the database named "Categories Configuration".
2.  To add a new category, simply click **New** and enter the category name. You can choose an appropriate icon (Emoji) to increase recognition.
3.  To modify an existing category, directly click and edit its name or icon.

When you add or edit a website in the "Navigation Links" database, the **Category** field will directly relate to this "Categories Configuration" database, allowing you to select one or more created categories like a dropdown menu.

## Using Tags

"Tags" is a multi-select property that provides a more flexible and detailed organization method than categories. You can add multiple tags to the same website to describe its technology, features, or uses.

For example, a website called "Figma" can belong to the "Design Tools" category while having multiple tags like "UI/UX", "Collaboration", "Prototyping".

**How to add or manage tags:**

1.  In the "Navigation Links" database, find the **Tags** column.
2.  Click on the tags field of an entry, and you can:
    -   Select from existing tags list.
    -   Directly enter a new tag name and press Enter to create it.
3.  You can manage all tag names and colors at any time by clicking on a tag and selecting **Edit property** > **Tags**.

Making good use of categories and tags allows you to quickly locate any website you need, even as your link collection continues to grow.
