# Collecting Sites

Notion Bookmarks provides multiple ways to help you quickly and conveniently collect and organize your favorite websites.

## Method 1: Browser Extension (In Development)

We are developing a browser extension that allows you to save the currently browsed webpage to your Notion database with one click. The extension will automatically capture the website's title, description, and icon, and allow you to quickly add categories and tags.

*Stay tuned!*

## Method 2: Manual Addition

You can also manually add new website links directly in the Notion database at any time.

1.  Open your copied "Navigation Links" database.
2.  Click **New** to create a new entry.
3.  Fill in the following fields:
    -   **Name**: The name of the website.
    -   **URL**: The complete URL of the website.
    -   **Description**: A brief introduction to the website.
    -   **Category**: Select one or more categories from the related category database.
    -   **Tags**: Add relevant tags for easy searching and filtering.

## Method 3: iOS Shortcuts

For iOS users, you can create a shortcut to quickly add links to your Notion database through the share menu. This requires basic knowledge of the Notion API and Shortcuts.

This is a powerful customization method that can greatly improve your bookmarking efficiency on mobile devices.
